            Bran Castle is a castle in Bran, 25 kilometres southwest of Brașov. It is a national monument and landmark in Romania. The fortress is on the Transylvanian side of the historical border with Wallachia, on road DN73.<br>
            <br>

Commonly known outside Romania as <strong class="vamp">Dracula's Castle</strong> (although it is one among several locations linked to the <strong class="vamp">Dracula</strong> legend, including Poenari Castle and Hunyadi Castle), it is often erroneously referred to as the home of the title character in <strong class="vamp">Bram Stoker's Dracula</strong>. There is no evidence that Stoker knew anything about this castle, which has only tangential associations with <strong><em>Vlad the Impaler</em></strong>, voivode of Wallachia, the putative inspiration for <strong class="vamp">Dracula</strong>. Dutch author Hans Corneel de Roos proposes as location for<strong class="vamp"> Castle Dracula</strong> an empty mountain top, Mount Izvorul Călimanului, 2,033 metres high, located in the Călimani Alps near the former border with Moldavia. Stoker's description of<strong class="vamp"> Dracula's</strong> crumbling fictional castle also bears no resemblance to Bran Castle.
